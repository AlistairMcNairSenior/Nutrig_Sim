# Nutrig_Sim
Code associated with A Caveat about the use of Trigonometric Functions in Statistical Tests of Nutritional Geometry Models 

Thales_Header.R contains a number of functions used, including some taken directly from Morimoto, 2023, "Nutrigonometry IV: Thales’ theorem to measure the rules of dietary compromise in animals” (Scientific Reports: Vol 13, article number 7466)".

Thales_Simulation.R performs the simulations described, and generates output files containing useful summary statistics (e.g., coverage of CIs, SEs etc).

Thales_plots.R makes all plots in the paper "A Caveat about the use of Trigonometric Functions in Statistical Tests of Nutritional Geometry Models", as well as perfoming some statistical tests therein.
